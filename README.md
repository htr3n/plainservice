This is a set of Eclipse plugins that together provides a simple DSL for creating and testing Web services. Following libraries and frameworks are used or based on:

* The plugins are based on the [Xtext framework](https://eclipse.org/Xtext)
* The generated Java code for Web services is mainly based on [Apache CXF](https://cxf.apache.org).

All are three Eclipse projects that can be imported directly to Eclipse for development purpose. There is a simle Hellworld example included in the "sdl.examples" to get the first feeling.

Any comments and suggesttions are greatly welcomed.
